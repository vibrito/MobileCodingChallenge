## Build tools & versions used
Xcode Version 15.4 

## Steps to run the app
Download the repository and run the app on Xcode. There's no step 3.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I spent one day, something about 5 or 6 hours. 

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
That challenge is very complex to finish with all the requirements. Complex apps, with all tests and a good architecture demand time. 

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I was short of time, so my tests are very poor.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
I choose not to use CocoaPods or any other dependency manager, because of time.
